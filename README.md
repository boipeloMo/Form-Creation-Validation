# 🧾 Form Creation and Validation

## 📘 Project Overview
This project implements a **User Registration Form** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It validates user inputs on the client side before form submission, ensuring data integrity and a smoother user experience.

The form checks that:
- The username is at least **3 characters long**
- The email includes both **"@"** and **"."**
- The password is at least **8 characters long**

If all validations pass, a green success message appears.  
If any validation fails, red error messages are shown.
